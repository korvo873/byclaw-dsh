# Trellis Finish Work

Run this skill to finish a task that has been archived or reported completed.

## Steps

1. **Confirm commit state.** If the working tree is dirty, return to the commit
   step and land the work commits first — never interleave bookkeeping commits
   with work commits. Note: `trellis_task_update(status: 'completed')` and
   `trellis_task_archive` enforce a hard git cleanliness guardrail and will
   reject operations if uncommitted code changes exist in the workspace.
2. **Run the commit flow** (work commits → archive commit → journal commit) if it
   has not already happened. Do not `git push` unless the user asks.
3. **Archive the completed task.** A task whose `status` is `completed` leaves
   the active board. Call the `trellis_task_archive` tool with the task slug: it
   atomically moves `.trellis/tasks/<slug>/` to
   `.trellis/tasks/archive/<yyyy-mm>/<slug>/` (month key = the slug's `mm` +
   the current year, e.g. `feat-08-15-x` → `2025-08`, shared with the kanban
   board reader; legacy slugs without an `mm-dd` go under `other/`) and unbinds
   every session that had the task bound. Archiving **moves** the record — never
   delete the task directory. Do not hand-craft the move or the session files;
   the tool is the single source of truth for the layout.
4. **Record the session.** Append a journal entry and update the personal index so
   cross-session tracking stays continuous.
5. **Wrap up.** Tell the user the task is closed and where the session record lives.

## Guardrails

- Never `git commit --amend`.
- Work commits first, then bookkeeping — in order.
- If the user commits by hand instead, skip to wrap-up once they confirm; do not
  present a second commit plan after a rejection.
